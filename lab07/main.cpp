/**
* Observer Design Pattern
*
* Intent: Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects
* about any events that happen to the object they're observing.
*
* Note that there's a lot of different terms with similar meaning associated
* with this pattern. Just remember that the Subject is also called the
* Publisher and the Observer is often called the Subscriber and vice versa.
* Also the verbs "observe", "listen" or "track" usually mean the same thing.
